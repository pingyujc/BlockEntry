BlockEntry is a web3 job board that aggregates job listing information from different websites and making it accessible for people that want to get into the blockchain industry.

To run and scrpe the jobs at Dejob for example, simply do 
```
python scraping_Dejob.py
```

It will then automatically scrape all the information from dejob and store it into a csv file.

After scrping is done, we will have csv file that shows the listing and they are also stored in the firebase database for future uses.
